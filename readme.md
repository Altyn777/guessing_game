SemVer - Semantic Versioning
The number 0.8.3 is a shorthand for ^0.8.3, which means any version that is at least 0.8.3 but below 0.9.0.

Cargo fetches the latest versions of everything that dependency needs from the registry, which is a copy of data from Crates.io.

After updating the registry, Cargo checks the [dependencies]. After downloading the crates, Rust compiles them and then compiles the project with the dependencies available.
